The goal of NetCoupler is to estimate causal links between a set of
-omic (e.g. metabolomics, lipidomics) or other high-dimensional
metabolic data and either a disease outcome, an exposure, or both. The
NetCoupler-algorithm, formulated by Clemens Wittenbecher and converted
into an R package by Luke Johnston, links conditional dependency
networks with an external outcome or exposure to identify direct effects
between them.

## CRAN submission

This fixes a CRAN note about "later-stage \Sexpr{} expressions".

## R CMD check results

Ran local (Ubuntu 24.04), GitHub Actions, winbuilder, and rhub checks.

0 errors \| 0 warnings \| 0 note

winbuilder has one note about a URL that has error 403, but
`urlchecker::url_check()` passes fine and I can open the URL myself on a
browser.
